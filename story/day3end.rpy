    w "Well… where do I begin? When I went for coffee with Somchai things were okay.
    But once he told me how much he regretted leaving me without telling me, I started to cry.
    Then, a moment later Dominic comes in…"

    Once they started drawing attention and getting louder Somchai eventually yelled about us having sex before.
    I was so pissed at that point I yelled at them to stop and…"

    I look over at Kyran and he’s shaking his head in disappointment."
    e """
    If we’re giving advice here I think you need to realize what each has to offer.
    You need to look at this rationally because this affects your life.

    If you can look past Somchai for hurting you that bad then choose him.
    If not, start something new with Dominic. I’ve seen him around the fields during
    the season and he’s really nice. He’s not like the regular jocks, so who knows where that will take you?
