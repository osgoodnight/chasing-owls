    w "Wait, how long were you watching us for."
    d "That doesn’t matter. I’m worried about you Wren."
    w "Worried? Why do you care so much about me Dominic? I just met you yesterday
    and now you’re all hung up on me. Are you stalking me or something?"
    d "No, Wren it’s nothing like that. When I met you I saw something in you that
    made me feel… something I’ve never felt before. And when you spoke to me that was the tipping point.
    From that moment on I knew I had to be with you."
    w "What does that even mean?"
    d "I don’t know, but that’s how I feel about you Wren. I don’t care about that
    guy or your past with him. What’s important is that you’re here, with me, right now. And I just want…"

    knee looking down at the ground."

    d "I want to ask for your forgiveness for causing a scene and… If you’d like…
    Wren will you go steady with me?"
    "What? go steady? Like what they used to do in the 60’s? Wow, he’s kind of...{w}romantic."
    w "Um~, I wasn’t expecting any of this, but I don’t know if this is the right moment for that."

    w "That would be mean. Also, I give second chances."
    d "Does that mean Somchai might have a chance with you, too?"
    "Honestly probably not but only time will tell, I guess."
    w "I don’t think so… but I can’t rule that out. He is a very determined individual.
    When we were together he was a good student and always promised me things that he would fulfill eventually."
    d "Damnit, that means I have competition."
    w "Maybe, he seemed pretty pissed at you and I know he still loves me.
    He’s probably going to try and win me back at any cost."
    d "Wren! Will you promise me to stay away from him?! I don’t trust that guy.
    Plus, I think I’m more attractive than him."
    w "Well, Dominic, I can’t really promise you much. And you should know looks aren’t everything.
    I’m the type of \"girl\" that likes a personality over anything."
