    "I don’t know what I want to eat, that's the problem."
    "Anything edible, really. Most foods are edible."

    s "Wren I swear to buddha…"
    w "OKAY fine never mind."
    "Wren sits there silently thinking to himself what he should get."
    "Gosh, I hate eating out with Somchai. He’s always so pushy when it comes to ordering food."
    "Why do I put up with this? We’ve only been dating for 5 months now. And yet, I still want to slap him."
    "Why does he have to be so damn sexy. Those eyes make my downstairs tingle in ways… wait, I should be trying to order. What should I get…?"
    s "Hey Wren."
    w "Yeah?"
    s "Do you… like me?"
    w "What type of stupid question is that? We’re dating aren’t we?"
    s "I know, I just feel like sometimes I bother you."
    w "Well, you do. But, there’s other aspects of you that I like."
    s "Like…"
    w "I can’t talk about those things in public anymore because you get upset and run into the bathroom when I bring them up."
    s "Damn it, Wren."
    w "I’m sorry your dick is above average."
    s "I feel the need to go to the bathroom."
    w "What? I’m just telling the truth. You started it."
    s "And I’m finishing it."
    w "Oh, yeah you \"finish\"."
    s "That’s it. I’m going to the bathroom."

    w "Called it."
    "Well, I guess that’s my cue to go in there and talk him out of the stall."

    w "When are you going to learn this has the opposite effect of what you want."
    s "I don’t know what you’re talking about."
    "Wren looks deeply into Somchai’s eyes. Then slowly lowers his gaze."

    "Wren wraps his arms around Somchai’s shoulders and neck. In return, Somchai lowers his hands to Wren’s lower back."
    "After several moments of passionate kissing…"
    s "You’re going to make it hard for me to walk out of this bathroom normally."
    w "That’s the plan."
    "Wren quickly releases Somchai and opens the stall door. But, before leaving Somchai to his \"problem\" Wren presses his ass against Somchai’s groin."
    s "Haa~"
    w "I’ll see you in 5 minutes."
    s "You~"
