    Actually...{w} they said they already knew. In Thailand it’s more accepted to be gay or bi.
    Something about Reincarnation...{w} and two souls being connected through different lives.

    Anyway, at the time, they felt sorry for me but couldn’t do anything about it
    because my grandparents needed help. After a year or so, I was still struggling
    with school and maintaining friends.

    Since I grew up mostly here in the states, the only things I really had in
    common with them were my ancestors and the language.

    My parents noticed this, so they saved up some money and sent me back here to talk to you and see you again.
